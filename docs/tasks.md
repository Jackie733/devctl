## Current: explain project-addition EOF and reject invalid requests explicitly (A01, M7)

Reported on 2026-10-19: a 1.6.1 client shows `Save completion is unknown` /
`unexpected end of file` after confirming an npm project addition. The user's
running supervisor version is not yet known. Reproduced the exact dialog with a
real pre-onboarding supervisor (`9c99851`, reporting 1.5.0) and the current client;
configuration bytes remained unchanged and the existing service stayed Running.
Updating the executable alone does not replace a detached supervisor.

Addition EOF now explains the possible older supervisor and explicit shutdown/reopen
recovery, including its effect on running services. Preserve unknown-outcome wording:
EOF can also mean a completed write lost its reply. Current supervisors return
normal error responses for invalid requests before dispatch instead of silently
closing the connection. No automatic retry, shutdown or configuration rewrite.

Validation on Linux:

- `cargo fmt --check`: passed.
- `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo test --locked -- --quiet`: passed, all 321 tests, including 17 PTY tests.
  Added regressions for addition EOF and explicit unknown/malformed request errors
  without dispatch. Final message refinements were followed by the same full suite.
- Real old/new-binary PTY reproduction and recovery passed: old-background EOF,
  unchanged configuration/running service, explicit shutdown, new-background reopen,
  successful npm addition and both services remaining stopped. No project npm
  command ran. Fixture: `/tmp/devctl-add-legacy-repro.py`.
- `git diff --check`: passed. Inspected the diff and checked balanced fences and
  all 58 local link paths across the four changed reference/task documents.

The user's WSL recovery and native macOS remain unverified. No release or
installation is included.

## Published baseline: 1.6.1 (U01 / M5, X03)

Authorized on 2026-10-18: defer startup-readiness work and publish the existing TUI
visual refinement. No startup observation interval, readiness detection, framework
adapter or new service-state meaning is included.

Scope: remove start/stop state flashes; coherent dark/light/terminal palettes;
stable selection through focus changes; whole-action footer hints; current-search
underline; reduced motion, ASCII status symbols and nonempty `NO_COLOR` support.
No new runtime dependencies. Native release checks now exercise the appearance
scenario against each optimized binary as well as the existing terminal scenarios.

[Release v1.6.1](https://github.com/Jackie733/devctl/releases/tag/v1.6.1) is public
and Latest, from annotated tag/build commit
`e7a484116fe7eeb464eff755bcf5b9e008949fd8`. The
[final workflow](https://github.com/Jackie733/devctl/actions/runs/39136166524) passed
both builds, publication and both anonymous public-verification jobs.

### Validation

- Local `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  and `cargo test --locked -- --quiet`: passed, 315 Rust tests.
- Hosted suites: 315 tests on Apple Silicon/macOS 14; 318 on Linux/Ubuntu 22.04.
  Both passed fmt/clippy, 14 installer and 8 merge checks, native artifact checks,
  4 package tests, and optimized terminal scenarios including appearance, lifecycle,
  high-output/large-redraw stop, clipboard, reconnect and history.
- Local `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0 cargo build --release --locked`, strict code
  signature verification, native install/reinstall/bad-checksum/rollback/config
  checks, 4 package tests and optimized appearance/high/lifecycle scenarios passed.
- Both public jobs passed anonymous downloads/digests, native execution/dependencies,
  latest/explicit version checks, installation, offline rollback/external recovery
  and configuration preservation.
- Independently downloaded all six attachments; verified both binary hashes/sizes,
  manifest targets, native Mac execution/signature and exact decompressed source
  archive identity against the release tag.
- Independent real public 1.5.0 → 1.6.1 default update passed in an isolated HOME:
  downloaded/verified the actual previous public Mac binary, confirmed the current
  release with the old client, performed its default update, matched new/backup bytes,
  preserved configuration, rolled back offline and restored via the external installer.
  Receipt: `/tmp/devctl-161-public-final-a4xofkwi/receipt.json`.
- `git diff --check` and the Markdown link/fence checker passed before tagging and
  for the final handoff: 17 documents, 172 local links/anchors, zero errors.

The initial v1.6.0 tag `bf22375` was not published as a Release.
[Its run](https://github.com/Jackie733/devctl/actions/runs/39135559760) passed Linux
but failed a Mac optimized lifecycle fixture. Reproduced that polling CLI state
without consuming terminal output could block its own queued control key. The
1.6.1 test correction drains live clients during polling, preserves deadlines and
assertions, and extends the high-output case to stop after a redraw exceeding the
terminal queue. The failed tag is preserved; no published artifacts were overwritten.

## Preserved handoff

- Local-time log capture and immutable `[out #N]` / `[err #N]` display landed in
  `28c488d` (L01/U01, M5). Linux fmt/clippy, all 319 tests (including 17 PTY tests)
  and documentation checks passed; the initial unrelated discovery-boundary failure
  passed isolated/full reruns. Real-terminal/Mac acceptance, release and installation
  of those changes remain pending.
- [Startup readiness comparison](tui-design-research.md#follow-up-startup-state-and-complexity):
  deferred on 2026-10-18, not cancelled from historical D01–D05 scope. Running still
  means a live process; readiness checks and even a startup observation interval
  remain unimplemented.
- The [AG01 integrated proposal](agent-research.md) remains proposed; engine isolation,
  masking, diagnosis quality, costs/performance and real Mac/WSL integration remain
  unverified. No Agent integration is included in this release.
- The local installed client uses the unreleased `12bb89f` build and still reports
  1.5.0. Its bytes, backup, unchanged configuration and installed appearance/control
  checks were verified; receipt: `/tmp/devctl-tui-install-a7q1d8kb/receipt.json`.
  Publication does not replace it or an already-running supervisor automatically.
- Previous [v1.5.0](https://github.com/Jackie733/devctl/releases/tag/v1.5.0) was published
  from `2574a7febd6075a03e4320d307e48eb59218a3aa`; its
  [final workflow](https://github.com/Jackie733/devctl/actions/runs/39043197453) passed.
  Keep those tags/artifacts intact.
- Daily-project onboarding/hot addition, physical terminal/font appearance on Mac/WSL,
  real user-environment update/rollback and user acceptance remain distinct from
  controlled tests and public artifact checks. A03 remains pending assessment.

## Next steps

1. Verify the user's WSL recovery after an explicit supervisor shutdown/reopen;
   inspect configuration/status before retrying.
2. Verify the new log display in the user's terminal with a newly built client.
3. Continue real-platform acceptance in [roadmap](roadmap.md) and [WSL verification](wsl.md).
4. Resume startup-readiness or AG01 implementation only after explicit scope approval.
